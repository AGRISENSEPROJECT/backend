## Problem Statement

Many smallholder farmers face challenges in optimizing agricultural productivity due to the lack of precise, real-time insights into soil health, crop conditions, and pest management. Current methods are often expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible. This results in:

- Mismatched crop selection based on incorrect soil composition.
- Inefficient fertilizer use leading to poor yields and soil degradation.
- Delayed detection of diseases and pests, causing significant crop losses.

AgriSense addresses these issues by offering a cost-effective, accessible solution that enables farmers to make data-driven decisions for better agricultural outcomes.
